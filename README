AutoProxy - the firefox proxy management add-on

What's New
===
Version 0.2.0 released at 08, Mar, 2009.
After ability of subscribe to pattern lists, we now can custom the proxy server.

More details see below.


Introduction
===
AutoProxy ==

  Better FoxyProxy (Use patterns to determine which or none proxy server to be
    used when connecting, no need to switch proxy status manually any more.) +

    * Better UI -- I think so (AutoProxy is derived from Adblock Plus, 
        if you like the interface of ABP, you may also like AutoProxy.)

    * More efficient -- the truth (matching algorithm has a constant time complexity, 
        the time used for matching is almost independent from the number of patterns)


  Subscribe (Like Adblock Plus. Advanced users can share their patterns to the 
    whole world/country/school..., while normal users even don't need to know 
    what a pattern is, just subscribe to a maintained pattern list. Even if people
    know well about this, why should we waste our time to write so many duplicate
    patterns again and again?) +


  Built-in Proxy Server (You also don't trouble to find and run a proxy server,
    here is a built-in one. Immediately work after install, no configuration
    needed -- Of course, you can turn it off and use other proxies.)




Where and How to Install
===
Install is very easy, just a click. Like other normal Firefox extensions.

  * Custom proxy servers;
  * ......
